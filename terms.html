    THE CONTENT AVAILABLE VIA THE SERVICES IS PROVIDED WITH THE UNDERSTANDING
    THAT NEITHER THE CREATOR NOR ITS AFFILIATES OR USERS ARE ENGAGED IN
    RENDERING MEDICAL, COUNSELING, LEGAL, OR OTHER PROFESSIONAL SERVICES OR
    ADVICE. SUCH CONTENT IS INTENDED SOLELY AS A GENERAL EDUCATIONAL AID. IT IS
    NOT INTENDED AS MEDICAL OR HEALTHCARE ADVICE, OR TO BE USED FOR MEDICAL
    DIAGNOSIS OR TREATMENT, FOR ANY INDIVIDUAL PROBLEM. IT IS ALSO NOT INTENDED
    AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR PROFESSIONAL ADVICE AND SERVICES FROM A QUALIFIED
    HEALTHCARE PROVIDER FAMILIAR WITH YOUR UNIQUE FACTS. NOTHING STATED OR
    POSTED ON THIS SITE OR AVAILABLE THROUGH ANY SERVICES ARE INTENDED TO BE,
    AND MUST NOT BE TAKEN TO BE, THE PRACTICE OF MEDICINE. OUR RECOMMENDED
    WORKOUT PLANS AND EXERCISES OR NUTRITION PLANS, EVEN IF THEY ARE TAILORED
    TO INDIVIDUAL USERS, SHOULD NOT BE MISCONSTRUED AS MEDICAL ADVICE,
    DIAGNOSES OR TREATMENT. ALWAYS SEEK THE ADVICE OF YOUR PHYSICIAN OR OTHER

    Neither the Creator nor any of its trainers or Affiliates will be liable
    for any physical or mental injury or illness that may result, whether
    directly or indirectly, from any of our recommended workout plans or
    exercises or nutrition plans. While we may provide guidelines such as
    written descriptions, pictures, or videos describing how to perform
    specific exercises or activities, you assume sole responsibility for
    performing those exercises or activities with proper form, as risk of
    injury or illness increases with improper form. We encourage you to seek
    multiple sources of information regarding how to perform each exercise
    correctly and to consider consulting with a qualified coach, instructor,
    personal trainer, or physical therapist, especially if you are new to any
    of the forms of training or activity you seek to perform.

    time and without prior notice. If the Creator amends this Terms of Use, it
    will update this posting on the Website and specify the effective date of
    the new version of the Terms of Use. Your continued use of the Services
    following the posting of a new version of the Terms of Use shall constitute
    your acceptance of any such amendments. Accordingly, you should check to
    see if a new version of the Terms of Use has been posted each time you use

    TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH, IF KNOWN BY HIM MUST HAVE MATERIALLY
    AFFECTED HIS SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR."
</p>
<p>
    <strong>13. Disclaimer of warranties</strong>
</p>
<p>
    YOU AGREE THAT THE USE OF THE SERVICES IS ENTIRELY AT YOUR OWN RISK. THE
    SERVICES ARE PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" BASIS. THE CREATOR
    EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,
    INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS
    FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. THE CREATOR DOES NOT MAKE

    THAT DEFECTS, IF ANY, WILL BE CORRECTED. THE CREATOR MAKES NO WARRANTIES AS

    jurisdictions, some of the foregoing disclaimers may not apply to you
    insofar as they relate to implied warranties.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>14. Limitations of liability</strong>
</p>
<p>
    UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL THE CREATOR OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATED ENTITIES
    BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES RESULTING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY FROM ANY ASPECT
    OF YOUR USE OF THE WEBSITE, CONTENT OR SERVICES. YOU MUST EVALUATE, AND
    AGREE TO BEAR ALL RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH, THE USE OF ANY CONTENT, INCLUDING
    ANY RELIANCE ON THE ACCURACY, COMPLETENESS, OR USEFULNESS OF THE SERVICES.
    YOU SPECIFICALLY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE CREATOR AND ITS AFFILATES ARE NOT
    LIABLE FOR THE DEFAMATORY, OFFENSIVE OR ILLEGAL CONDUCT OF USERS OR THIRD
    PARTIES. ADDITIONALLY, IN NO EVENT WILL THE CREATOR OR ITS ANY OF ITS

    PUNITIVE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY LOSS
    OF USE, LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF DATA, COST OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE
    PRODUCTS OR SERVICES, OR ANY OTHER SUCH DAMAGES, HOWSOEVER CAUSED, AND ON
    ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER FOR BREACH OF CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING
    NEGLIGENCE AND STRICT LIABILITY), OR OTHERWISE RESULTING FROM (1) THE USE
    OF, OR THE INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICES; (2) THE COST OF PROCUREMENT OF
    SUBSTITUTE SERVICES, ITEMS, OR WEBSITE; (3) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO OR
    ALTERATION OF YOUR TRANSMISSIONS OR DATA; (4) THE STATEMENTS OR CONDUCT OF
    ANY THIRD PARTY ON THE SERVICES; OR (5) ANY OTHER MATTER RELATING TO THE
    SERVICES. THESE LIMITATIONS WILL APPLY WHETHER OR NOT THE CREATOR HAS BEEN
    ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES AND NOTWITHSTANDING ANY FAILURE
    OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED REMEDY. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND UNDERSTAND
    THAT THE DISCLAIMERS, EXCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY SET FORTH
    HEREIN FORM AN ESSENTIAL BASIS OF THE AGREEMENT BETWEEN YOU AND THE CREATOR
    AND THAT ABSENT SUCH DISCLAIMERS, EXCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY,
    THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS TERMS OF USE AND YOUR ACCESS TO THE
    WEBSITES AND SERVICES WOULD BE SUBSTANTIALLY DIFFERENT. In some
    jurisdictions, limitations of liability are not permitted. In such
    jurisdictions, some of the foregoing limitations may not apply to you.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>15. Indemnification</strong>
</p>
<p>
    You agree to indemnify and hold harmless the Creator, its directors,
    officers, employees, agents, and affiliates, from and against any and all
    liability, damages, losses, claims, expenses of any kind (including,
    without limitation, reasonable attorneysâ€™ fees) directly or indirectly
    related to (1) your breach of the Terms of Use; (2) the User Content you
    submit, post, or transmit through the Services; or (3) your use of the
    Services.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>16. Termination and survival</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Either party may terminate the Terms of Use for any or no cause, at any
    time. After termination, you agree that you shall no longer access or
    utilize the Services. The provisions of this Terms of Use which by their
    intent or meaning are intended to survive such termination, including
    without limitation the provisions relating to disclaimer of warranties,
    limitations of liability, indemnification and dispute resolution shall
    survive the any termination of this Terms of Use and any termination of
    your use of or subscription to the Services and shall continue to apply
    indefinitely.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>17. Severability</strong>
</p>
<p>
    If any provision of the Terms of Use is found by a court or other binding
    authority to be invalid, you agree that every attempt shall be made to give
    effect to the partiesâ€™ intentions as reflected in that provision, and the
    remaining provisions contained in the Terms of Use shall continue in full
    force and effect.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>18. Dispute resolution</strong>
</p>
<p>
    You and Creator agree to resolve any disputes between us in accordance with
    this Section 18. If you believe that Creator has not adhered to the Terms
    of Use or you have any dispute with Creator, please contact Creator using
    the contact information provided below. We will do our best to address your
    concerns and we will attempt to resolve any disputes with you amicably.
</p>
<p>
    Except as provided herein, you and Creator agree that we will resolve any
    disputes between us that we cannot resolve as provided above through
    binding and final arbitration instead of through court proceedings. All
    such controversies, claims, counterclaims, or other disputes arising
    between you and Creator relating to the Websites, the Services or this
    Terms of Use (each a "Claim") shall be submitted for binding arbitration in
    accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA").
    If AAA is not available to arbitrate, the parties shall agree to select an
    available alternative dispute resolution provider ("ADR Provider") and the
    rules of such provider shall govern all aspects of the arbitration. The
    arbitration will be heard and determined by a single arbitrator. The
    arbitratorâ€™s decision in any such arbitration will be final and binding
    upon the parties and may be enforced in any court of competent
    jurisdiction. The parties agree that the arbitration will be kept
    confidential and that the existence of the proceeding and any element of it
    (including, without limitation, any pleadings, briefs, documents, or other
    evidence submitted or exchanged and any testimony or other oral submissions
    and awards) will not be disclosed beyond the arbitration proceedings,
    except as may lawfully be required in judicial proceedings relating to the
    arbitration or by applicable disclosure rules and regulations of securities
    regulatory authorities or other governmental agencies.
</p>
<p>
    For any claim where the total amount of the award sought is $10,000 or
    less, the AAA (or ADR Provider, if applicable), you and Creator must abide
    by the following rules: (a) the arbitration will be conducted solely based
    on written submissions; and (b) the arbitration will not involve any
    personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually
    agreed by the parties. If the claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing
    will be determined by the AAA (or ADR Provider, if applicable) rules.
</p>
<p>
    If you demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as
    compared to the costs of litigation, Creator will pay as much of the
    administrative costs and arbitratorâ€™s fees required for the arbitration as
    the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the cost of the arbitration from
    being prohibitive. In the final award, the arbitrator may apportion the
    costs of arbitration and the compensation of the arbitrator among the
    parties in such amounts as the arbitrator deems appropriate.
</p>
<p>
    This arbitration agreement does not preclude you from seeking action by
    federal, state, or local government agencies. You and Creator also have the
    right to bring qualifying claims in small claims court. In addition, you
    and Creator retain the right to apply to any court of competent
    jurisdiction for provisional relief, including pre-arbitral attachments or
    preliminary injunctions, and any such request shall not be deemed
    incompatible with this Terms of Use, nor a waiver of the right to have
    disputes submitted to arbitration as provided in this Terms of Use.
</p>
<p>
    Neither you nor Creator may act as a class representative or private
    attorney general, nor participate as a member of a class of claimants, with
    respect to any Claim. Claims may not be arbitrated on a class or
    representative basis. The arbitrator can decide only your and/or Creatorâ€™s
    individual Claims. The arbitrator may not consolidate or join the claims of
    other persons or parties who may be similarly situated.
</p>
<p>
    If any provision of this Section 18 is found to be invalid or
    unenforceable, then that specific provision shall be of no force and effect
    and shall be severed, but the remainder of this Section 18 shall continue
    in full force and effect. No waiver of any provision of this Section 18
    will be effective or enforceable unless recorded in a writing signed by the
    party waiving such a right or requirement. Such a waiver shall not waive or
    affect any other portion of this Terms of Use. This Section 18 will survive
    the termination of this Terms of Use or your relationship with Creator.
</p>
<p>
    THIS SECTION LIMITS CERTAIN RIGHTS, INCLUDING THE RIGHT TO MAINTAIN A COURT
    ACTION OR TO HAVE A TRIAL BY JURY, THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN ANY FORM OF
    CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE CLAIM AND THE RIGHT TO ENGAGE IN DISCOVERY EXCEPT
    AS PROVIDED IN AAA RULES OR THE RULES OF AN ADR PROVIDER.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>19. Applicable law and venue</strong>
</p>
<p>
    This Terms of Use and the resolution of any dispute related to this Terms
    of Use will be governed and interpreted by and under the laws of Cyprus,
    without giving effect to any conflicts of laws principles that require the
    application of the law of a different state. The United Nations Convention
    on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods does not apply to this
    Agreement. Any dispute relating in any way to the Services or this Terms of
    Use will be adjudicated in any state or federal court in Cyprus.
</p>
<p>
    Notwithstanding the provision in the preceding paragraph with respect to
    applicable substantive law, the enforceability of Section 18 entitled
    "Dispute Resolution" shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (9
    U.S.C., Secs. 1-16).
</p>
<p>
